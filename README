Wordpress plugin for managing martial arts students.
To be used with PHP versions >=5.3

TODO:
Allow programs & belts to be set when creating a new user
Seperate ma_accounts.php and possibly options.php into multiple files
Add option to track how often students login
Update Accounts page in backend to support pagination. Maybe Belts & Programs page too.
Thinking about find a new name for $ma_accounts->validate_input
