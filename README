Wordpress plugin for managing martial arts students.
To be used with PHP versions >=5.3

TODO:
Add option to track how often students login
Sort accounts by name, belt or program.
Allow batch updating.
Allow setting belt & account information when creating a new user
Update Accounts page in backend to support pagination. Maybe Belts & Programs page too.
Thinking about find a new name for $ma_accounts->validate_input
Look into making it easier for people to style by using models
